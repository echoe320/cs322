LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL

Things to do for tmr
1) issue: we have array of Item pointers, but can't access private fields
2) test computation of GEN and KILL sets
3) get our visitor to instantiate ('too few arguments' thing)
4) compute IN and OUT sets from GEN, KILL, successor/predecessor


NEW TODO:
- toString
- get methods for each class field?

################ CHANGELOG ASYNCRONOUS #####################

Update Eugene Jan 29, 2021:
- added reg_list for callee, caller, arg 
  -> used reg::rdi to get the int value for reg enum values
- fixed loops creating callee, caller, arg 
  -> used static_cast<reg>(count) instead of reg(count)
  -> arg_reg_list for arg registers
- started creating get() for each instruction class
  -> changed L2.h to include get functions in the each instruction class
  -> finished implementing get() functions for Instruction_assignment, Instruction_arithmetic, Instruction_crement, Instruction_shift, Instruction_cmp, Instruction_lea,
