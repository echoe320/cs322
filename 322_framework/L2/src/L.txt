LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL

TODO:
1) rework liveness.cpp::create_liveness_list() (see comment i made above set vector initialization)
2) test computation of GEN and KILL sets
3) test findSuccessorsPredecessors()
4) compute IN and OUT sets from GEN, KILL, successor/predecessor

#################### CHANGELOG ASYNCRONOUS ##################### (new entries go to top of stack)
02/26/2022 Eugene:
- debugged issue with pointers segment faulting. Changed filling Item * vector from Item* objects to Register * regi = new Register(rdi); and directly pushing (regi) into the stack(see rdi register parser for an example). 
- Gen and kill now prints lists -> need to check for correctness and for outlier cases.
- Next steps: check if findSuccessorsPredecessors works properly, implement the liveness algorithm.

02/08/2022 Both:
- implement typeAsString() methods for instructions (for debugging)


02/01/2022 Eugene:
- Change from program to function for parse_function_file
- Test gen/kill sets


02/01/2022 Jacob:
- implemented ACTUAL toString() methods for Register, Number, Label, Variable
  -> don't see any need for the other Item subclasses yet
- added a findSuccessorsPredecessors() method to function class
  -> only implemented successors, not predecessors
    -> successors are represented as integers, since we only need the indices (i.e. we can access successors with f.instructions[successor_idx])
    -> changed Instruction fields successor_idx and predecessor_idx to reflect this semantic
    -> code is not the prettiest, but it should work, DID NOT TEST yet (im not sure how to test it lmao)
- added a section in liveness.cpp::create_liveness_list() for computing IN and OUT sets
- updated our TODO list

01/30/2022 Eugene:
- debugging
  -> fixed the toString method for all item classes
  -> added constructor for Instruction_ret -> seems to error without
  -> fixed getting the reg from Mem r field
  -> fixed getting the number from N field for Instruction_calls and Instruction_runtime

01/29/2022 (Jacob):
- change VisitInstruction() methods to use get() instead of directly accessing fields
- remove 'using namespace std;' from liveness.cpp
  -> to avoid confusion between std::get<idx>(myTuple) and myClass.get()
- add toString method to parent Item class to allow dynamic_cast
  -> if there is no virtual function to override, you can't use dynamic_cast because the class isn't polymorphic 
  -> add toString override methods to Item's children
    -> none of the toString methods actually work lmao they just return empty string (i just needed it so the classes are recognized as polymorphic)
- updated our TODO list

Update Eugene Jan 29, 2022:
- added reg_list for callee, caller, arg 
  -> used reg::rdi to get the int value for reg enum values
- fixed loops creating callee, caller, arg 
  -> used static_cast<reg>(count) instead of reg(count)
  -> arg_reg_list for arg registers
- started creating get() for each instruction class
  -> changed L2.h to include get functions in the each instruction class
  -> finished implementing get() functions for Instruction_assignment, Instruction_arithmetic, Instruction_crement, Instruction_shift, Instruction_cmp, Instruction_lea, Instruction_calls, Instruction_runtime, Instruction_label, Instruction_goto, Instruction_stackarg -> all Instruction classes have get()
  -> used i.e. std::tuple<Item*, Item*, Item*> get() -> access the fields using indexing?
